<b>Model Evaluation and Validation</b></br>
<b>Project: Predicting Medical Insurance Charges</b></br></br>
<b>Install</b></br>
This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy</br>
Pandas</br>
matplotlib</br>
scikit-learn</br></br>
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook.

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

<b>Code:</b></br>
Template code is provided in the Linear Regression medical insurance.ipynb notebook file. You will also be required to use the included interface.py Python file and the medical_insurance.csv dataset file to complete your work. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project. Note that the code included in interface.py is meant to be used out-of-the-box and not intended for students to manipulate. If you are interested in how the visualizations are created in the notebook, please feel free to explore this Python file.

<b>Run:</b></br>
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory Testing/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

ipython notebook  Linear Regression medical insurance.ipynb
or

jupyter notebook Linear Regression medical insurance.ipynb
or open with Juoyter Lab

jupyter lab
This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

<b>Data:</b></br>
The medical_insurance consists of 1338 data points, with each datapoint having 6 features.

<b>Features:</b></br>

age: age of the customer
sex: sex of the customer
